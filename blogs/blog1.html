    "Love"—isn't it a feeling everyone strives for? Longs for? Is it something that sustains us, or is it a luxury? Does everyone stand a chance? Does anyone truly stand a chance of finding it? Or is it just lust we misinterpret? Is it a feeling, an action, or a responsibility? Is it something everyone has to oblige, or is it only for the people who deserve it or chase it?
   </p>
   <p>
    What I interpret it as is a concoction of all of these: a feeling that transitions into responsibility, a luxury which could become a necessity, and an obligation which should be kept.
   </p>
   <h3>
    What is Love?
   </h3>
   <p>
    This is a complex question to answer in a single line or a paragraph; the answer takes form based on the circumstances and the point of view from which it is based. We will look at the most common reference to it: a relationship. Do we need love to be in a relationship? Is love a necessity?
   </p>
   <h3>
    What is love in a relationship?
   </h3>
   <p>
    "People fall in love with the wrong people sometimes"—this is something we have heard a lot, but this is the furthest thing from love. Falling in love with the wrong person destroys the whole point of love. Love is not something you get or feel in a moment; it is something cherished. It is a feeling cherished every single day, minute, and second. There is no one who is "wrong" here; the idea of a person being wrong in love is absurd. The moment someone is wrong, it was never love to begin with.
   </p>
   <p>
    "Love at first sight" is something many people are fascinated by, but I think of it as the ultimate misrepresentation of love. I would consider "enemies to lovers" as more real than people who fall in love at first sight. The only thing you notice at first sight is a person's looks and how they carry themselves; how could that make you want to live with them forever? This is nothing but a mere misinterpretation of lust as love. This is the situation that leads to "falling in love with the wrong person," but this couldn’t really be called falling in love, could it?
   </p>
   <h3>
    What makes a person wrong? How does love make it right?
   </h3>
   <p>
    Many face troubles during a relationship, but from this, can we conclude that a person is "wrong"? Can a relationship built on love be broken because of these troubles? My simple answer is: it was never love to begin with.
   </p>
   <p>
    Even though I don’t believe in many things said about love, I do believe "every lover is a fighter." How can you be a lover when you don’t fight for it? Love makes things right. Even though obstacles make a person seem "wrong" for a relationship, true love overthrows every obstacle to make things right. Let's take the most common trouble faced in relationships: societal pressure (differences in status, caste, financial background, etc.). Do you really think these could be a reason for a person to leave the one they love? The answer is simple: it was never love to begin with. True love is when you put it above anything else.
   </p>
   <h3>
    The weight of love
   </h3>
   <p>
    Everything in this world is weighed: your salary, weight, opinions, and even your love. A person could have love for many things—for example, money, family, status, etc.—but each of these loves is weighed. When your love for money is above your partner, there is no doubt you'll let them go if it comes down to a choice between the relationship and money. It was—again—never true love to begin with. When you weigh your status over your partner, it is obvious you are going to leave when it comes to your status versus your partner.
   </p>
   <p>
    The weight you give to your relationship decides if it was true love. This weight invites you to sacrifice from the beginning—a sacrifice which could cost you everything you’ve loved since childhood, which could bring you to ruin. But that is where true love comes hand-in-hand: even when you have nothing, love stays. Love stays when you have everything to lose, and when you have nothing left to lose.
   </p>
   <h3>
    What does love look like?
   </h3>
   <p>
    Is love buying expensive gifts? Let's say, expensive gifts when you have nothing—is that love? Going out of your way to do something impressive to win over your partner—is that love? No, it is not.
   </p>
   <p>
    Love is when you gift them a pack of tissues knowing they catch colds easily; it's when they think of calling you first when they can’t sleep; it's making hot soup because you know they love it during winter. Love is knowing you, love is sacrificing for you, love is for you. If gifting expensive stuff were true love, only Elon Musk or the top 2% of the population would find it. It was never about money, education, knowledge, or status; it is something that outweighs all of those.
   </p>
   <h3>
    Defining True Love
   </h3>
   <p>
    True love is absolute, as the Bible says in 1 Corinthians 13:4-7:
   </p>
   <p>
    "4 Love is patient, love is kind. It does not envy, it does not boast, it is not proud. 5 It does not dishonor others, it is not self-seeking, it is not easily angered, it keeps no record of wrongs. 6 Love does not delight in evil but rejoices with the truth. 7 It always protects, always trusts, always hopes, always perseveres. 8 Love never fails."
   </p>
   <p>
    This is the most unerring definition of true love. True love outweighs everything. It becomes something you can't live without—something that sustains you. It is not a luxury, but a necessity.
   </p>
   <h3>
    Who is the perfect example of True Love?
   </h3>
   <p>
    It is none other than our Lord Jesus Christ. His love outweighed everything He had: heaven, His throne, and His holiness. He thought everything was of no use if I wasn’t able to get there. You might wonder why I am suddenly referring to my own perspective; it is because this is me describing my only true love.
   </p>
   <p>
    He didn’t ask anything from me apart from myself, which is the least I could give. It didn’t come to me at first sight; it was something I am learning to cherish every day. He makes all obstacles go away. There is nothing that could separate me from Him because His love outweighs everything. He was not of my ethnicity, He didn’t even speak my language, but He still loved me the same. Nothing else mattered to Him. This love is not built on luxury or expensive gifts, but on the most precious gift of salvation on the cross, paid with the greatest sacrifice: His own life. He took all my wrongs to make them right. Even when I couldn’t love Him as much as He did, it was I He wanted—not anything else from me. This is the perfect and absolute example of love.
   </p>
   <h3>
    Who deserves love?
   </h3>
   <p>
    Everyone. No one in this world deserves to live without love. We might not be lucky enough to find someone to care for us in this world, but there is always our Heavenly Father who loves us more than anyone else can. A relationship that does not have Christ at the center will eventually fail because human love is fleeting, but His love compensates for it to make it whole. "If God is for us, who can be against us?" If He is the center, no matter the obstacle or pain, He will guide and lead us, for it was He who brought us together.
